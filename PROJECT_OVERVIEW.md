# üéì Go Microservices Capstone Project

## Project Overview

You now have a complete, working Go microservices system! This project demonstrates core microservices patterns with three interconnected services built in Go.

### ‚úÖ What You've Built

1. **User Service (Port 8081)** - Handles user management and authentication
2. **Product Service (Port 8082)** - Manages product catalog with sample data
3. **Order Service (Port 8083)** - Processes orders, coordinates with other services

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

- **Independent Services**: Each service has its own codebase, data, and API
- **HTTP Communication**: REST APIs for both external and inter-service communication  
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation between data access and business logic
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper service lifecycle management
- **CORS Support**: Ready for frontend integration
- **Docker Ready**: Full containerization support
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Request logging and error tracking

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Quick Start (5 minutes)
```bash
# Build all services
./scripts/build.sh

# Start all services
./scripts/run.sh

# Test the system
./scripts/test.sh
```

### 2. Verify Everything Works
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8081/health
curl http://localhost:8082/health  
curl http://localhost:8083/health

# Create a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# List products (comes with sample data)
curl http://localhost:8082/products

# Create an order (use actual user and product IDs from above)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"USER_ID","items":[{"product_id":"PRODUCT_ID","quantity":1}]}'
```
